    title: "1. What is SOP?",
    content: "Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a guideline provided/set by police management or government to guide police officers in their work. It includes processes for identifying reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and determining appropriate force levels.\nðŸ“Œ Example: SOP may outline exactly when an officer may frisk a suspect or escalate force. It ensures consistency and legality in law enforcement operations."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "2. Code of Ethics vs Code of Conduct",
    content: "Code of Ethics reflects the values officers must embody, like integrity, impartiality, and accountability.\nCode of Conduct covers behavior expectations like wearing a clean uniform, reporting misconduct, and obeying legal orders.\nðŸ“Œ Example: If an officer sees a colleague taking bribes, ethics demand honesty, while conduct rules require reporting it."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "3. Chain of Command",
    content: "The chain of command is the structure through which orders flow, from superiors to subordinates. Officers must follow duty-related orders but can report unlawful or personal commands.\nðŸ“Œ Example: A cadet must block a road if instructed by a sergeant, but may refuse to do a personal errand and report it."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "4. Bonafide vs Non-Bonafide Evidence",
    content: "Bonafide evidence is legally collected and reliable (e.g., fingerprints, bodycam footage).\nNon-Bonafide evidence is unverified or illegally obtained (e.g., hearsay, hidden recordings).\nðŸ“Œ Example: A confession after Miranda is bonafide; a secretly recorded conversation without consent may be inadmissible."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "5. Frisk vs Search",
    content: "A frisk is a limited pat-down for weapons, allowed with reasonable suspicion.\nA search is more thorough, requiring probable cause or a warrant.\nðŸ“Œ Example: Frisk a suspect loitering at night; search their bag only if you see contraband or smell drugs."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "6. Miranda Rights",
    content: "These are legal rights read during custodial interrogation:\n\nâ€¢ You have the Right to remain silent\nâ€¢ Anything said may be used in court\nâ€¢ You have the Right to an attorney\nâ€¢ If unaffordable, state will provide one, If available\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: If rights aren't read before questioning, the confession may not be admissible."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    title: "7. Levels of Force",
    content: "The SOP uses a force continuum:\n\n1. Officer Presence\n2. Verbal Commands\n3. Empty-Hand Control\n4. Less-Lethal Force (tasers, batons)\n5. Lethal Force (firearms for deadly threats)\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A calm subject may only need verbal commands, but a gunman may justify lethal force."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    title: "8. De-escalation of Force",
    content: "De-escalation is calming a situation through communication, reducing police presence, or offering exits.\nðŸ“Œ Example: Talking down a threatening individual rather than tasing them helps avoid violence."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    title: "9. Escalation of Force",
    content: "Escalation means raising force if verbal or soft tactics fail.\nðŸ“Œ Example: If a suspect refuses to comply and begins resisting, an officer may escalate to taser use."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    title: "10. Match of Force",
    content: "This principle requires officers to apply equivalent or slightly superior force to neutralize threats.\nðŸ“Œ Example: If a suspect uses a knife, an officer may draw a gun."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    title: "11. 10-Codes",
    content: "Radio shorthand used for quick, effective communication.\nðŸ“Œ Example: \"10-80\" means pursuit in progress, and \"10-4\" means message acknowledged."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    title: "12. Types of Warrants",
    content: "â€¢ AOS (Arrest on Sight): Immediate arrest authority\nâ€¢ Search & Seizure Warrant: For specific items, judge-approved\nâ€¢ Raid Warrant: For raiding property; broad scope\nâ€¢ KOS (Kill on Sight): For terrorists only\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: AOS allows immediate detention; search warrant limits you to listed items."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    title: "13. Bail",
    content: "Allows a suspect to await trial outside custody.\n\nâ€¢ Misdemeanor: Magistrate grants bail\nâ€¢ Felony: Needs judge approval\nâ€¢ Bail = 3x charges value\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: Bail may be denied if suspect is a flight risk or repeat offender."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    title: "14. Detain vs Arrest",
    content: "â€¢ Detain: Temporary stop for investigation; needs reasonable suspicion\nâ€¢ Arrest: Full custody with charges; needs probable cause\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A man matching a robbery suspect's clothing may be detained, but not arrested without further proof."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    title: "15. Types of Crimes",
    content: "â€¢ Infraction: Minor (e.g., jaywalking)\nâ€¢ Misdemeanor: Moderate (e.g., trespass)\nâ€¢ Felony: Serious (e.g., armed robbery)\nâ€¢ HUT: Held Until Trial (e.g., terrorism)\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: Stealing a car is a felony; speeding is an infraction."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    title: "16. BOLO vs Warrants",
    content: "â€¢ BOLO: \"Be On the Lookout\" alert; no arrest power\nâ€¢ Warrant: Legal order to arrest or search\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A BOLO vehicle can't be stopped unless matching a crime. A warrant gives legal arrest authority."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    title: "17. Use of Taser",
    content: "Guidelines include:\n\nâ€¢ Avoid wet areas or heights\nâ€¢ Cooldown between uses\nâ€¢ Warn suspect before deploying\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A fleeing suspect may be tased, but not while running on stairs or near water."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    title: "18. N+2 Rule",
    content: "Officers must outnumber suspects by at least 2.\nðŸ“Œ Example: Confronting 2 suspects needs minimum 4 officers. Exceptions: high-risk crimes like kidnappings or terrorism."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    title: "19. Reasonable Suspicion",
    content: "Allows a brief stop or frisk based on specific behavior or context.\nðŸ“Œ Example: Someone pacing nervously outside a store at night may be detained and questioned."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    title: "20. Probable Cause",
    content: "Stronger than reasonable suspicion; allows arrest, search, or warrants.\nðŸ“Œ Example: Seeing stolen goods in plain view or matching fingerprints gives probable cause to arrest."
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    title: "21. Reports/FIR vs Chargesheet",
    content: "â€¢ FIR/Report: First complaint filed by officer\nâ€¢ Chargesheet: Official document with evidence for prosecution\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A theft FIR may become a chargesheet if CCTV proves the suspect's guilt."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    title: "22. Type of Settlement",
    content: "â€¢ Plea Bargain: Lighter sentence for guilty plea\nâ€¢ Diversion: Offender avoids jail by joining rehab/community service\nâ€¢ Civil Compromise: Case dropped after compensation\n\nðŸ“Œ Example: A minor drug offender may complete a rehab program to avoid criminal record."
